# Search-algorithm-comparison
  Comparison between different search algorithms
  
## Introduction
Python script to compare time required for different search algorithms to search an element in sorted array of size 10000000
elements.<br><br>

!!There are total 10000000 elements in this script array.It will take around 280mb size.

## Development
I will make the code clean and add multiple arrays to compare different algorithms on different size arrays.
