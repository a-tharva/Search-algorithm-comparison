## Introduction
Python script to compare time required for different search algorithms to search an element in sorted array of size 10000000
elements.<br>
!! There are total 10000000 elements in the search script array. It will take around 280mb size.
 - Comparison between different search algorithms

```

## Modules
matplotlib
```
pip install matplotlib
```

## Development
- I will make the code clean and add multiple arrays to compare different algorithms on different size arrays.
- Add search in data structure
- Clean old code
